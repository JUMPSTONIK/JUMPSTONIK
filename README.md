- And more...

There are more projects that I'll be adding soon as a Pokedex, a Chat(like a whatsapp clone), a Instagram clone and my personal website, but I'm still working on them. 

## What am I working now?
Now I'm working to learn or improve in some technologies. Most of them I have learned how to used them before, but I want to get a deeper knowledge too. Some of those technologies are:
- SQL(PostgreSQL and/or MySQL) & NoSQL(MongoDB and Redis)
- SASS and Less
- Docker
- Redux,
- Tailwind and/or Bootstrap
- Cloud(AWS or GCP)
