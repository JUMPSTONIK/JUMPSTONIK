# Hey there, I'm Josue David Lopez Florian

<h2 style="text-align: center">
 <i>On my degree, I am a Computer Science engineer. In my mind, I am a coder andÂ choreographer. But in my heart, I am a developer, an artist and Athlete.</i>
</h2>

I'm a Frontend and Full-stack developer. I consider myself as a great Frontend developer, because I love what I do, and I prefer to let my work show you my skills. Furthermore, I have the desire to grow fast, be a better developer to become an expert as Frontend developer and a Data Scientist in the future.Â Beside my work as a developer, I love dancing, playing a big variety of video games, learn new technologies, create some side project to try new things and never stop learning.

- And more...

There are more projects that I'll be adding soon, as a Pokedex and my personal website, but I'm still working on them. 

## What am I working now?
Now I'm working to learn or improve in some technologies. Most of them I have learned how to used them before, but I want to get a deeper knowledge too. Some of those technologies are:
- SQL(PostgreSQL and/or MySQL) & NoSQL(MongoDB and Redis)
- SASS and Less
- Redux,
- Tailwind and/or Bootstrap
- Cloud(AWS or GCP)
