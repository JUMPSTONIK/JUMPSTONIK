# Hey there, I'm Josue David Lopez Florian

Welcome to my safe haven! ðŸ‘‹

I'm open to work and looking for a startup to continue my career as a Frontend or Fullstack developer. I've been working with several technologies like HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Typescript, React.js, Node.js, Express, Redux, Styled-components, Material-UI, JWT, Babel, Webpack, PostgreSQL, MongoDB Git/Github, Command line/Bash and Jest. I consider myself as a great Frontend developer, because I love what I do and I prefer let my work show you my skills. I dont have too much experience, but I have the desire to grow fast, become a great developer become an expert as Frontend developer and a Data Scientist in the future.

Beside my work as a developer, I love dancing, playing a big variaty of videogames, learn new technologies, create some side project to try new things. I have a big passion for coding and work as a Frontend developer its one of the thing I love the most. Thats why I stater learning all the last tecnologies I mention and I keep learning more everyday.
